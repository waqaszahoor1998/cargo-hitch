# Cargo Hitchhiking Simulation Requirements
# These are the Python packages needed to run the simulation

# Core Python libraries (usually included with Python)
# No external packages required for basic functionality

# Optional packages for enhanced functionality:
python-docx>=0.8.11  # For reading DOCX documentation files
pandas>=1.3.0        # For data analysis (optional)
openpyxl>=3.0.0      # For reading Excel files (optional)

# Note: The simulation works with just Python standard library
# The above packages are only needed if you want to analyze documentation files
